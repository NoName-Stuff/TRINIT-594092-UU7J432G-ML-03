st.write("Soil is a critical resource for agriculture, providing the necessary nutrients and support for plant growth. India has a diverse range of soils, with varying compositions and characteristics that affect crop productivity. This report provides an overview of the major soil types in India and their composition.")

st.write("Alluvial soils: These are formed by the deposition of sediments by rivers and are found in the Indo-Gangetic plain. They are rich in organic matter and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium.")

st.write("Black soils: Also known as regur or black cotton soils, these are found in the Deccan plateau region. They are rich in iron, magnesium, and aluminum but are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter.")

st.write("Red soils: These are mainly found in the Deccan plateau and are formed by the weathering of igneous rocks. They are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter, but are rich in iron oxide.")

st.write("Laterite soils: These are found in the coastal regions of India and are formed by the weathering of rocks in hot and humid conditions. They are rich in iron and aluminum but are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter.")

st.write("Forest and mountain soils: These are found in the hilly regions of India and are formed by the weathering of rocks. They are rich in organic matter and minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium.")

st.write("The composition of soils in India varies widely, and different soil types have different characteristics that affect crop productivity. Understanding the composition of soils is important for farmers to make informed decisions about soil management practices and crop selection. By leveraging modern technology and science, farmers can optimize their use of these resources and improve crop yields.")
