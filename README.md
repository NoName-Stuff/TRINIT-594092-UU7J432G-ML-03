Some of the features are described below:<br>
<b>Crop Prediction:</b> The <b>RandomForestClassifier</b> algorithm was chosen as the classification model due to its ability to handle categorical data and its high accuracy. The data was split into training and testing sets. A RandomForestClassifier was fit to the training data, using the state, district, and price features. The hyperparameters were tuned using cross-validation to improve the accuracy of the model. The accuracy of the model was evaluated on the testing set and was found to be 90%. <br>
<b>Indian Agriculture:</b> Agriculture plays a critical role in India's economy, contributing to approximately 17% of the GDP and employing over 50% of the workforce. However, farmers face several challenges, such as low productivity, climate change, and market fluctuations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to address some of these challenges, by predicting crop yields, identifying pests and diseases, and optimizing inputs.<br>
<b>Soil Composition:</b> Soil is a critical resource for agriculture, providing the necessary nutrients and support for plant growth. India has a diverse range of soils, with varying compositions and characteristics that affect crop productivity.<br>
